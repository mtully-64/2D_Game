# My 2D Game
This project is a creation of a 2D game in **Java**, with **no external libraries**. 
Using only pure Java features, this game was developed to enhance and explore the intricate/complex task of game development.
This project showcases a custom-built game engine, performance, modularity and clarity of design. Overall, this will serve as both a playable game and a technical foundation for more advanced Java development.

### Features
- Game loop architecture
- Responsive input system
- Collision detection and basic physics
- Sprite management and animation
- Scalable object-oriented design
